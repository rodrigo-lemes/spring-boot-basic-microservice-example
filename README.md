# spring-boot-basic-microservice-example
This project was created by Rodrigo Soukef Lemes dos Santos to be used as an example to create a complete micro-service with spring boot and basic angularJS front-end.

With this micro service example you can:

- Register a new car.
- Search a specific car by license plate.
- Create a list with all registered cars.
